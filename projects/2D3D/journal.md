# Journal on the Progress of "2D3D"

## Entry 1 - 06/09/2021

Came up with the idea for the short film yesterday. But then I
realized it is too ambitious for a short film.

It's about a guy with an ability to do astral flight and enters into
an interdimensional world hidden in our dimension. All told in first
person perspective - edited to look like it has no interruption.

Then I have an idea that I can cut out some parts of it.

I thought about using Unreal engine to make this, but both installing
and operating this causes pain in my ass. One Unreal Engine in Linux
alone takes 43 GB of it. And the compilation time takes way longer
than I thought.  Like a cancer tumor. Maybe I should either use Unity
or Blender. But it did give me an excuse to clean and reorganize my
Linux files.

Make your to move your video references into your Arch Linux's Vidoes
folders.

I just realized I need to check out clips of *Hardcore Henry*.

And today is my sister's birthday.

Look into this link:

I believe Blender is one way to go. I could use Unity.

But first, let's try make various assets.

And also, I am writing this with newly installed AwesomeWM.

To make some concept arts, I need to sketch some interior set first
with pencils and sketchbook papers.
