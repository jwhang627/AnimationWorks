Entry 1 - 06-09-2021

Came up with the idea for the short film yesterday. But then I realized it is too ambitious for a short film.

It's about a guy with an ability to do astral flight and enters into an interdimensional world hidden in our dimension. All told in first person perspective - edited to look like it has no interruption.

Then I have an idea that I can cut out some parts of it.

I thought about using Unreal engine to make this, but both installing and operating this causes pain in my ass. One Unreal Engine in Linux alone takes 43 GB of it. Like a cancer tumor. Maybe I should either use Unity or Blender. But it did give me an excuse to clean and reorganize my Linux files.

Make your to move your video references into your Arch Linux's Vidoes folders.

I just realized I need to check out clips of Hardcore Henry.

And today is my sister's birthday.
