2D characters in 3D environments

Shot and edited like it is done in one continuous shot.
(See Enter the Void, Birdman, 1917, Rope etc.)

Ideas:
- The camera floating above the character; doing the birds eye view.
-- Astral Flight
--- The man who has an ability to perform astral flight enters into a spirit world that causes the haunting of the building.
- 4:3 aspect ratio (in some scenes).
- Black and white in some scenes, but colored in other scenes.
