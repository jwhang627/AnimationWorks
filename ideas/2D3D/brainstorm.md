# Brainstorming

2D characters in low-poly (for the sake of simplicity) 3D environments

Shot and edited like it is done in one continuous shot, and told from
first-person perspecitve.

(See *[Enter the Void](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1191111/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)*, *[Birdman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)*, *[1917](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)*, *[Rope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)*, *[Hardcore Henry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3072482/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)*, etc.)

## Ideas

* The camera floating above the character; doing the birds eye view.
	* Astral Flight (Working Title: *Astral*)
		* The man who has an ability to perform astral flight enters into a spirit world that causes the haunting of the building.
* 4:3 aspect ratio (in some scenes).
* Black and white in some scenes, but colored in other scenes.
* Haunted house on earth has pastel color palette, while the spirit world are made up of cut-outs.
	* Has anyone came up with the idea of pastel colored haunted house horror movie?
